If the bike has multiple front chainrings, shift the front derailleur to the largest chainring, then shift the rear derailleur to the smallest cog. Even if you are already in the smallest cog, keep clicking your rear shifter to make sure there are no clicks left in the mechanism. This makes sure that the rear shifter is fully actuated outward."

First turn the H-limit screw count-clockwise a few turns. Pedal and see if it makes the shift outward. If it still does not shift outward, turn the barrel adjuster on the derailleur body clockwise a few rotations. Pedal to see if it shifts. Your chain should now be on the smallest cog and there should be no more clicks left in the shifter mechanism. Turn the barrel adjuster clockwise another two turns, or until it is screwed in all the way, whichever comes first. The reason we do this comes from the earlier point regarding shifting position and proper limit screw settings. This will move the shifting positions beyond the limit screw setting so we will get an accurate assessment of current limit screw settings. We are now ready to dial in the H-limit screw."

The H-limit screw will cause the derailleur to move. Find the correct setting by first making the H-limit screw adjustment too tight. Now back out the H limit screw until it sits directly below the smallest cog. Take your screwdriver and tighten the H-limit screw one half turn. Listen for excessive noise while pedaling. If there isn’t any excessive noise coming from the drivetrain, tighten the screw until you hear the chain rubbing on the next cog. Once you hear the excessive noise, begin to back out the H-limit screw one quarter turn at a time until the noise stops. If there are two settings that seem equally quiet, go with the tighter of the two settings. The H-limit is now set.",
        "notes": "The idea is to bring it back to roughly where it was before. Don’t worry if it isn’t completely precise just yet. As far as the L-limit screw, we will wait to adjust that until after we have adjusted the derailleur indexing and cable tension."

Pedaling at a normal riding cadence, shift the shifter only one indexed click, not more than one click. We want this one click to shift one, and only one gear. If the chain did not make it to the next gear, return the shift lever to the outermost click, and turn the barrel adjuster one full turn counter-clockwise. Try the shift again and repeat the process until it makes the shift. If you have un-threaded the barrel adjuster that it has come out, or has nearly come out, thread the barrel back in fully and then out one or two turns. Make sure that you are on the furthest outward shift position and the smallest cog, then remove the slack from the cable at the pinch bolt.",

This will provide the most protection from the derailleur shifting the chain beyond the largest cog and into the spokes. Shift the chain to the next to largest chainring in front. Shift to the second largest cog in the rear. Now, try shifting to the largest cog in order to determine where the L-limit screw is currently set. If the chain does not make the shift, than the L screw is already too tight, and that’s where we want it for now. If the chain shifts slowly to the largest cog, that is also a symptom of a too tight L screw. If there is excessive noise when the chain is on the largest cog, again, the L screw is too tight. If it makes an acceptable shift with no excessive noise, the L screw is not too tight. Shift the derailleur one click outward and tighten the L screw one turn clockwise and check the shift again. Repeat this process until there are symptoms of a too tight L screw. Once the too tight L screw is causing symptoms, turn the L screw out one quarter turn until and check the shift to the largest cog until the symptoms of excessive noise and slow shifting go away. The L-limit is now set.",

The majority of road and mountain bike derailleurs require a gap between 5 and 6 millimeters. You can use a hex wrench to gauge this distance. Don’t get too hung up on this particular adjustment. If the bike is shifting well, the B screw is probably within acceptable adjustment range. To increase the gap, tighten the B screw. To decrease the gap, loosen the B screw. If you do make significant changes to the B screw, double check the indexing adjustment. Otherwise you are done, and your derailleur is properly adjusted.",
